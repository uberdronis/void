## Python Learning

++ Setup Notes ++
- Don't forget to ALWAYS use virtualenv when working with this project in DEV.
- When using virtualenv, always ensure to update the requirements.txt file by running the following:
  - `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
- When setting up a virtualenv or developing on a local machine, make sure to install all dependencies:
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Obviously, NEVER run these setup commands outside of a controlled dev/test environment.**
